# \<portfolio-app\>

Portfolio site using polymer! I chose polymer because its currently my favorite javascript framework for making web apps. *Disclaimer* If I need native app support, React-Native is better. :)

For web only products I feel polymer is one of the best in terms of speed, compatibility and dev quality of life.

App is somewhat inspired by Material Design. I love MD but I still want my app's to feel unique.

## Features

- Lazy Loaded resources
- Adopts the PRPL Pattern recommended at Polymer Summit
